# Agricultural Smart Assistant
## Abstract
            A DL-driven IoT based agriculutural assistant aimed at removing human interaction in the 
            irrigation process and suppy water based on the needs derived from the environmental 
            constraints (Temperature, humidity, soil moisture) to preserve electricity, 
            prevent over usage of water, thus leading to overflooding of fields 
            which may lead to drowning of multiple crops and hence their products going to waste.
